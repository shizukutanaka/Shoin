# CLAUDE.md: Shoin (書院) Developer Guide

## Project Overview

**Shoin** is a local, citation-verified alternative to NotebookLM designed for offline research and knowledge work. It bundles PDF, Markdown, HTML, TXT files and URLs into "notebooks" and allows you to ask questions grounded strictly in those sources. Unlike cloud-based alternatives, all data stays local and no queries are sent externally. The name (書院 / shoin) means a scholarly study or library room in classical Japanese architecture.

**Key Design Principle**: Lightweight. Shoin targets 4–8 GB RAM systems running small open-source LLMs (Qwen3-4B, Phi-4, Gemma-3), not large proprietary models. It works without an LLM entirely—falling back to retrieval only when the endpoint is unavailable.

**Core Use Case**: Researchers, students, and professionals read long documents (research papers, reports, books) and want to ask questions with full source citation verification, zero external dependencies, and confidence that their private documents never leave their machine.

### Architectural Layers

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           Web UI (single-file HTML)             │ User-facing
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Web Server (HTTP/SSE)  + CLI (subcommands)    │ API & I/O
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Q&A (query expansion, context build, prompts) │ Logic
│  Studio (5 output kinds), Citation verification │
│  Search (BM25 + vector, fusion, rerank, MMR)   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Ingest (extract text from PDF/HTML/URL)       │ Input
│  Chunk & Index (token-aware splitting, FTS5)   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Store (SQLite + WAL, migrations, FTS5 index)  │ Persistence
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  LLMClient (OpenAI-compatible async wrapper)   │ LLM Bridge
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Each layer is independent: the pipeline works without an LLM, retrieval works at any scale, the UI degrades gracefully when unavailable.

## Core Concepts

### Source Grounding via S-numbers

Every answer and Studio output cites sources as `[S1]`, `[S2]`, etc. These are **not magic**: they are indices into the notebook's ranked retrieval results, regenerated fresh for each query. The mapping is transparent to the user; clicking `[S1]` jumps to the first relevant source.

**Why S-numbers?** Lightweight LLMs struggle with long source titles and URLs in the context window. `[S1] [S2]` takes 2 tokens; the full text of "https://example.com/very/long/research/paper#section2" takes 10+. For 2.4K token budget and 6-turn history, brevity matters.

**Citation Extraction** (`citation.py`):
- Pattern: `[SsＳｓ]` (ASCII/full-width S variants) followed by digits, optionally comma/semicolon/`and`-separated
- Examples: `[S1]`, `[Ｓ１]`, `[S1, S2]`, `[S1 and S3]` all parse correctly
- First pass: extract all cited numbers, validate they fall in range 1..N_sources

### Citation Verification: Three-Layer Machine Checks

Citation hallucination (fabricated quotes, wrong numbers) is one of the most user-visible LLM failure modes. Shoin runs three dependency-free, LLM-free checks on every assistant response and Studio output:

**1. Range Check** (`validate_citations`): Detect `[S99]` when only 5 sources exist. Out-of-range numbers are the narrowest, highest-confidence hallucination signal.

**2. Grounding Confirmation** (`verify_grounding`): A cited sentence's wording is compared to the source text using character-bigram overlap. When overlap >= 30% (CONFIRM_MIN, calibrated for CJK), the citation is flagged `confirmed` — strong positive evidence the claim is lexically supported.

**3. Mis-numbering Detection** (`verify_grounding`): When a sentence does *not* match its cited source but *does* strongly match a *different* source (with a 20% gap margin, MISMATCH_GAP), the citation number is flagged `misattributed` — the model likely cited the wrong source.

**Key Design Decision**: Lexical overlap is asymmetric. High overlap reliably *confirms* support. Low overlap is inconclusive—a correct synonym paraphrase and a true misattribution both score ~0. So the checks only *assert* what they can stand behind (confirmation, or a wrong number) and *stay silent otherwise* rather than falsely accusing a correctly paraphrased answer. No aggregate grounding score is emitted; the `confirmed` and `misattributed` lists are the complete signal. See CHANGELOG v0.1.4 for the design rationale.

### History Management: Stripping Stale Citations, Deduplicating Roles

Shoin supports multi-turn conversation by including up to 6 recent prior turns in the prompt context (HISTORY_MESSAGES=6, each truncated to 160 tokens to keep total budget ~2.4K). Challenges:

**Stale Citation Stripping**: When including message N-1 in the prompt for query N, the [S1]..[Sn] numbers from the previous context are stale—they don't match the fresh retrieval for query N. If the model echoes stale numbers, they become meaningless. Solution: remove all `[S#]` markers from history messages before re-prompting.

**Role Deduplication**: In parallel requests, Thread A may be retrieving while Thread B adds a new source and flushes its questions cache with an older fingerprint. Race condition: Thread A's cached result overwrites Thread B's newer one. After history_messages() processes chat turns and skips empty assistant turns, the msg sequence can become [user₁, user₂, asst₂] (two consecutive user turns), violating OpenAI API alternation. Solution: strip both trailing user turns at the end AND any consecutive same-role pairs in the middle (`history_messages`, v0.1.52).

### Vector + BM25 Hybrid Retrieval with MMR Diversity

Retrieval combines two signals:

**BM25 (Full-Text Search)** via SQLite FTS5 trigram tokenizer:
- Query `query_terms()` extracts ASCII words and contiguous CJK runs (e.g., "Shoin書院" → ["Shoin", "書院"])
- CJK terms are decomposed into trigrams: 書院 → [書院, 院理] etc. (prefix-free overlap for recall)
- ASCII terms >= 3 chars are kept as-is
- FTS5 MATCH expression is OR-joined for recall; BM25() scoring ranks denser matches higher
- Fallback: LIKE scan for short queries (< 3 chars) when FTS5 index misses them, limited to 2000 rows

**Vector Search** (optional):
- Each chunk is embedded via `ChatBackend.embed_one(text)` when embeddings are enabled
- Cosine similarity is computed in-process over notebook chunks (local scale, no external API)
- Normalizes NaN/Inf results to 0.0 (guards against corrupted embeddings from broken endpoints)

**Fusion** (Convex Combination):
- Linear combination: `score = alpha * vec_score + (1-alpha) * bm25_score`
- Adaptive alpha: natural-language queries (ending in `？`, `?`, or `か`) get higher alpha (+0.15) to prioritize semantic search
- Min-max normalization accounts for different score ranges per query (scores are local, not global)

**MMR Reranking** (Maximum Marginal Relevance):
- After fusion, the top-k hits are reranked to maximize relevance while minimizing redundancy
- Lexical overlap (character bigrams) measures diversity; the next selected hit must be both relevant and differ from already-selected hits
- Prevents result lists dominated by near-duplicate chunks (e.g., different pages of the same multi-page document)

**Degradation**: When embeddings are disabled, the pipeline uses pure BM25 (first-class mode, not a fallback).

### Markdown Newline Normalization

Markdown and plain-text sources arrive with mixed line endings: `\r\n` (Windows), `\r` (old Mac), `\n` (Unix). Inside HTML, extracted text may also have `<br>` tags or implicit paragraph breaks. Challenge: preserve intentional line breaks (e.g., poetry, lists) while normalizing incidental whitespace.

**Solution**: Chunks are split sentence-by-sentence first (regex on `.!？。；！`, plus `\n\n` paragraph boundaries). Within each sentence, **only** sequences of 2+ newlines are collapsed to a single space; single newlines become spaces. This preserves hard line breaks (poetry) while merging soft wraps (reflowing paragraphs).

See `chunk.py` `_hard_split()` and citation.py `_SENTENCE_SPLIT_RE`.

### WAL Mode + FTS5 Cascade Deletes

SQLite persistence uses Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) mode to allow concurrent reads while writes are pending. This is essential for the web server's `ThreadingHTTPServer` which spawns a thread per request.

**Cascade Deletes**: Every foreign key is `ON DELETE CASCADE`. When a source is deleted, all its chunks are deleted; when a notebook is deleted, all sources/chunks/notes/messages/studio_outputs in that notebook are deleted. The FTS5 virtual table is kept in sync via triggers (`chunks_ai`, `chunks_ad`, `chunks_ad`), so the trigram index never accumulates orphaned entries.

**Migrations**: Schema changes are recorded in `MIGRATIONS` list (append-only). Each migration is tagged with a version number and applied once at startup. Migrations 1–4 are:
1. Initial schema (notebooks, sources, chunks, FTS5, notes, studio_outputs, messages)
2. Add `notebook_id` indexes (performance)
3. Add settings table (for tracking embed model version)
4. Add composite message index for recent-message retrieval

## Strengths (Audited and Correct)

### SSRF Guard with DNS Pinning

When a user adds a URL source, Shoin fetches the content over HTTP. An SSRF vulnerability would allow an attacker to request internal endpoints (e.g., `http://169.254.169.254/`) to extract cloud metadata. Shoin's defense:

1. **IP Pinning** (ADR-001): When resolving a hostname, the first resolution result is pinned. If the hostname later resolves to a different IP (DNS rebinding attack), the request is rejected.
2. **Localhost Rejection**: IPs in `127.0.0.0/8`, `::1/128`, and `169.254.0.0/16` (link-local) are rejected outright.
3. **HTTP Only**: `file://` and other schemes are not supported.

Code: `ingest.py` `fetch_url()` and `_check_ip_pinning()`.

### Atomic Database Operations

Multi-step operations (ingest source → chunk → embed → FTS index) are wrapped in SQLite transactions. If any step fails (LLM down, disk full, malformed PDF), the entire source is rolled back; no orphaned chunks or half-indexed data left behind.

Example: `pipeline.py` `index_source()` opens a transaction, adds the source row, chunks it, embeds them, and updates the settings table. If embedding fails partway, `except LLMError` rolls back the entire transaction.

### Token-Aware Truncation

The context window is budgeted: 2400 tokens, allocated as:
- ~900 tokens: system prompt + source headers
- ~1000 tokens: source text (split equally across TOP_K sources)
- ~400 tokens: recent history (6 messages, 160 each)
- ~100 tokens: user query

When truncating source text to fit the budget, naive character truncation would split mid-word or mid-UTF-8-sequence. Solution: `chunk.py` `_truncate_tokens(text, limit)` scans left-to-right, counts tokens via `estimate_tokens()` (which models LLM tokenizer behavior for CJK and punctuation), and stops exactly at the limit without mangling characters.

Token estimation models:
- ASCII words: 1 token per word (~4 chars)
- CJK characters (including Hiragana/Katakana/Hangul/Thai/Lao/Myanmar/Khmer): 1 token per character
- Punctuation (。、　 etc.): 1 token per character

### Lexical Overlap Verification

The bigram-overlap check in `verify_grounding()` compares claim vs. source using character bigrams after NFKC normalization and whitespace stripping. Example:

```
Claim: "猫が好きです。"
Source: "私は猫が大好きです。犬も好きです。"
Bigrams claim: {"猫が", "が好", "好き", "き。"}
Bigrams source: {"私は", "は猫", "猫が", "が大", "大好", "好き", "き。", "。犬", "犬も", "も好", "好き", "き。"}
Overlap: {"猫が", "好き", "き。"} / 4 = 0.75 >= CONFIRM_MIN (0.30) → confirmed
```

The check is conservative: single bigrams like `好き` (common adjective suffix) alone won't trigger confirmation; the claim must hit 30% of its bigrams in the source. This avoids false positives from shared particles and formality markers.

## Known Weaknesses & Tech Debt

### Lightweight LLM Compatibility (Limited Token Budget)

**Problem**: Qwen3-4B, Phi-4, and similar models have smaller context windows (4K–8K tokens) than GPT-4 (128K). Shoin's 2400-token context budget is conservative, leaving room for prompt overhead. However, this means:

- Long sources are truncated; users may not see the full text.
- Rare multi-turn conversations (10+ turns) risk dropping early history due to token limit.
- Very large notebooks (500+ sources) retrieve only TOP_K=10 sources, potentially missing nuanced cross-source synthesis.

**Mitigation**: The design is intentional. Shallow context encourages focused, specific questions rather than open-ended exploration. For exploratory work, Studio outputs (briefing, timeline, mindmap) pre-synthesize the sources into digests.

### No Batch Embeddings API Support

**Problem**: `ChatBackend.embed_one(text)` embeds a single chunk at a time. Ingest of a 100-chunk source triggers 100 HTTP requests to the embeddings endpoint (Ollama `/api/embeddings`, llama.cpp `/embeddings`).

**Impact**: Ingest of large PDFs is slow (~2–5 seconds per source on typical hardware). For users adding dozens of sources in a session, this compounds.

**Why Not Fixed**: Ollama and llama.cpp have different batch API signatures and conventions. Shoin prioritizes simplicity and broad compatibility (works with any OpenAI-compatible endpoint). A batch API would require vendor detection or optional configuration.

**Workaround**: Disable embeddings (leave `SHOIN_EMBED_MODEL` unset) if ingest speed matters more than semantic search.

### UI State Management Could Be More Robust

**Problem** (fixed in v0.2.21): SSE StrockError during streaming could orphan messages (user query saved, assistant response lost). History reconstruction would see dangling user turns and output malformed message sequences to the LLM.

**Fix** (`history_messages`, v0.1.52 onward):
- Catch connection errors during SSE and save partial responses.
- Deduplicate consecutive same-role turns: if a user turn is orphaned (no assistant reply), the next message processing removes it.

**Remaining**: Concurrent notebook switches during question-fetch could display wrong recommendations. This is a race condition in the browser (not the server). Low priority since the UI is single-user.

### No Distributed Tracing

**Problem**: In production deployments, debugging slow queries across the retrieval → LLM → response pipeline is opaque. No request ID, no server-side timing logs.

**Why Not Fixed**: Shoin targets single-machine deployment. Logging would bloat the binary and add I/O overhead. Users who debug often look at Flask/Django logs; Shoin's minimal HTTP server doesn't have equivalent introspection.

**Workaround**: Add `DEBUG=1` environment variable to print timing/retrieval stats to stderr.

## Version History: v0.1.37 → v0.2.21

### v0.2.21 (2026-06-21)
**Fixed**: Deleting the last notebook left the header title, source list, chat, and studio showing stale content from the deleted notebook. `loadNotebooks()` entered the `!notebooks.length` branch without calling `renderNotebook()`. Fix: call `renderNotebook()` (with `cur=null`) and add an `else` branch in `renderNotebook()` that explicitly clears chat, studio, notes, question chips, and hides the source-empty indicator when `cur === null`.

**Fixed**: The degraded-mode badge (`#degBadge`, "検索のみ" / "search only") was only reset in the SSE `done` handler and was never cleared when switching notebooks. After switching away from a notebook whose last answer was degraded, the badge remained visible for the new (non-degraded) notebook. Fix: hide `#degBadge` at the start of `renderChatHistory()`.

### v0.2.20 (2026-06-21)
**Fixed**: `history_messages()` had a trailing-user guard (`while out and out[-1]["role"] == "user": out.pop()`) but no symmetric leading-assistant guard. When the `HISTORY_MESSAGES=6` window landed mid-pair (the paired user question is outside the window), the history started with an assistant message, giving the LLM the sequence `[system, asst, user, ...]` — protocol-unusual for OpenAI-compatible APIs. Fix: add `while out and out[0]["role"] == "assistant": out.pop(0)`.

### v0.2.19 (2026-06-21)
**Fixed**: `export_markdown()` lacked newline normalization on notebook name, source titles, source origins, and note titles. A title containing `\n` (e.g., from a source with a multiline HTML title) would silently produce two separate Markdown list items or headings instead of one. BibTeX (`_bib_escape`) and RIS (`_ris_escape`) already normalized newlines; added `_md_line()` helper to match.

**Fixed**: Unexpected exceptions in `_dispatch()` (e.g., `sqlite3.OperationalError: database is locked` after busy_timeout expires) were unhandled — the HTTP framework logged a traceback but sent no response, so the client received an abrupt connection close. Fix: add catch-all `except Exception` in `_dispatch()` that logs to stderr and returns HTTP 500 with error code `SYSTEM_INTERNAL_ERROR`.

### v0.1.37 → v0.1.55

### v0.1.55 (2026-06-14)
**Fixed**: `_post()` not using `errors="replace"` when decoding LLM response; non-UTF-8 bytes (Latin-1 error messages, binary junk) would raise `UnicodeDecodeError` instead of being caught and converted to `LLMError`. Discovered via Socratic question "do all 3 decode sites have consistent error handling?"

### v0.1.54 (2026-06-14)
**Fixed**: `adaptive_alpha()` stripping trailing punctuation then checking if query ends with `?` (unreachable code); English questions like "What is Shoin?" lost semantic-search boost. Use `rstrip(" \t\n")` before the endswith check.

### v0.1.53 (2026-06-14)
**Fixed**: `questions_cache` TOCTOU race when adding sources concurrently; older fingerprint could overwrite newer cache entry. Guard with fingerprint check before write.

### v0.1.52 (2026-06-14)
**Fixed**: `history_messages()` skipping cite-only assistant turns generated consecutive user messages, violating OpenAI API alternation. Add post-loop deduplication of same-role pairs.
**Refactored**: `_SENTENCE_SPLIT_RE` duplicated in chunk.py and citation.py; consolidate to single source of truth.

### v0.1.51 (2026-06-14)
**Fixed**: `_is_cjk_word()` treating 々 (iteration mark, U+3005) as punctuation, breaking "人々" queries. Add exception: 0x3005 stays part of CJK word runs.

### v0.1.50 (2026-06-14)
**Fixed**: `chat_stream()` silently swallowing `{"error": "..."}` SSE events from Ollama/llama.cpp. Check for `"error"` key before accessing `"choices"`.
**Fixed**: `_h_ask_sse()` overwriting partial LLM output with error prefix on mid-stream failure. Append instead of replace.
**Fixed**: `suggest_questions()` unreachable code after NFKC normalization (？→?, ！→!). Simplify to `rstrip("。．!?")`.

### v0.1.49 (2026-06-14)
**Fixed**: v0.1.48 regression: FTS5 generating trigrams like "書院。" including punctuation. Add `_is_cjk_word()` to exclude U+3000–U+303F.
**Fixed**: `_char_bigrams("")` returning `{""}` instead of `set()`, causing empty Hit to score 1.0 in MMR.

### v0.1.48 (2026-06-14)
**Fixed**: CJK symbol/punctuation block (U+3000–U+303F: 。、　) not included in `_CJK_RANGES`, so token estimation underestimated Japanese text. Add the block.
**Fixed**: `_SENTENCE_SPLIT_RE` not treating full-width semicolon ； as sentence boundary.

### v0.1.47 (2026-06-14)
**Fixed**: `_h_ask_sse()` saving empty assistant message when client disconnects before LLM sends any tokens. Add `if full:` guard.

### v0.1.46 (2026-06-14)
**Fixed**: `export_ris()` missing blank lines between RIS entries (2001 spec requires them). Use `"\n\n".join()`.

### v0.1.45 (2026-06-14)
**Fixed**: `_minmax()` returning all-1.0 when all scores are 0 (IDF=0, common words). Special case: if `lo < 1e-12` return 0.0.

### v0.1.44 (2026-06-14)
**Fixed**: `suggest_questions()` not stripping full-width list prefixes (１. ２） ３、). Apply NFKC normalization before lstrip.

### v0.1.43 (2026-06-14)
**Fixed**: `_SENTENCE_SPLIT_RE` in citation.py not including ； (full-width semicolon), causing sentence splitting to diverge from chunk.py.

### v0.1.42 (2026-06-14)
**Fixed**: `_CJK_RANGES` missing Thai/Lao/Myanmar/Khmer blocks, token estimation way off. Add U+0E00–0E7F, U+0E80–0EFF, U+1000–109F, U+1780–17FF.
**Fixed**: `_SENTENCE_SPLIT_RE` not treating ； as sentence end.

### v0.1.41 (2026-06-13)
**Fixed**: Timeout and connection refused mapped to same error code. Distinguish via `exc.reason` check for `TimeoutError`.

### v0.1.40 (2026-06-13)
**Fixed**: `add_message()` without existence check, FK constraint error uncaught. Add `store.get_notebook()` guard.

### v0.1.39 (2026-06-13)
**Fixed**: `add_studio_output()` same FK issue. Add notebook existence check.

### v0.1.38 (2026-06-13)
**Security**: `/sources` API accepting file paths as `target`, allowing SSRF to read `/etc/passwd`. Restrict to `http://` / `https://` URLs only.

### v0.1.37 (2026-06-13)
**Fixed**: `embed()` silently discarding embeddings when server returns fewer results than requested. Add length validation.

---

## Testing & Debugging

**Test Suites**: `tests/test_*.py` — unit tests for store, citation, Q&A, server SSE, Studio. Run `pytest tests/`.

**Debugging Aid**: Set `DEBUG=1` to see retrieval stats (BM25 scores, vector scores, fusion alpha) printed to stderr. Useful when result relevance seems off.

**Common Issues**:
1. **Embeddings disappearing after model change**: Check `settings` table for `embed_model` value. If NULL or stale, run `shoin reindex <notebook_id>` to rebuild.
2. **BM25-only mode unexpectedly active**: Confirm `SHOIN_EMBED_MODEL` is not empty/whitespace. Use `(llm.embedding_model or "").strip()` check.
3. **SSE stream cuts off mid-token**: Check client logs for `ConnectionResetError`. Partial responses are now saved (v0.1.47+), but may appear incomplete in UI.
4. **Citation report shows empty `confirmed`/`misattributed` lists**: This is normal—means all citations are in the inconclusive (paraphrase) category. No error.

## Deployment Notes

**System Requirements**:
- Python 3.10+
- SQLite 3.34+ (for FTS5 trigram tokenizer)
- 8GB RAM minimum for 4B LLM + Shoin
- Local OpenAI-compatible endpoint (Ollama, llama.cpp, LM Studio)

**Configuration** via `~/.config/shoin/config.json` or environment variables:
- `SHOIN_LLM_URL`: Base URL (default `http://localhost:11434/v1`)
- `SHOIN_LLM_MODEL`: Generation model (default `qwen3:4b`)
- `SHOIN_EMBED_MODEL`: Embedding model (default empty; BM25-only if unset)
- `SHOIN_DATA_DIR`: SQLite path (default `~/.local/share/shoin`)
- `SHOIN_PORT`: HTTP port (default 7440, 127.0.0.1 only)

## Contributing & Philosophy

**Design Principles**:
1. **Zero External Dependencies**: urllib only. No requests, no numpy, no PyTorch. Slim binary, easy to audit.
2. **Lightweight First**: Target 4–8B LLMs explicitly. Trade some capability for speed and memory.
3. **Local by Default**: All data stays on disk. No cloud telemetry, no opt-out required.
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Search works without LLM. Studio outputs have fallback text. History_messages() survives malformed chats.
5. **Citation Integrity**: Three-layer verification, but only assert high-confidence findings. Silence when unsure, don't accuse.

**Code Style**: 
- Type hints everywhere (Python 3.10+ syntax).
- Dataclasses for domain objects (frozen where possible).
- Functions, not classes, for utility logic.
- Docstrings explain *why* not just *what*.
- Test file per module (`test_X.py` for `X.py`).

**Adding Features**: 
- Start by reading `Plan.md` and relevant CHANGELOG entries to understand design decisions.
- Add migrations in `store.py` MIGRATIONS list (append-only, never edit shipped entries).
- Update CLI, server routes, UI in tandem.
- Add i18n strings to `_STRINGS` dicts in affected modules.
- Run tests: `pytest tests/` and manual UI check.
